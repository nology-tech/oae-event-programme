          Ripping Up the Rulebook & Starting From Scratch

          More than three decades ago, a group of musicians took a good look at that curious institution we call the orchestra, and decided to start again from scratch. They began by throwing out the rulebook. Put a single conductor in charge? No way. Specialise in repertoire of a particular era? Too restricting. Perfect a work and then move on? Too lazy. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment was born. Questioning. Challenging. Trailblazing. On this page we look at our history, values and approach to playing music.

          When we play Bach, we play on instruments and use techniques that would have been familiar to Bach himself in the early 18th century.

          Then when we play Brahms, we change our instruments to those from Brahms' time in the mid-19th century. This gets you closer to the experience you would have had at the time the music was written.

          There are some quite radical differences between historic instruments and modern ones. For example, our strings are made of sheep gut rather than metal. And our wind instruments often don't have valves as their modern counterparts do.

          Our Orchestra was founded in 1986. Then, a group of idealistic period instrument players was determined to free itself from the shackles of working under an all-powerful music director and take charge of their own destiny.

          Our first concert was on Thursday 26 June at Oxford Town Hall with violinist Sigiswald Kuijken. A second followed the next day at Southbank Centre's Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. The programme included Telemann, Rameau and Haydn's Symphony No. 83 La Poule.

          In 1987, we worked with Simon Rattle to bring a landmark production of Mozart's opera The Marriage of Figaro to Glyndebourne. We also secured a recording contract with Virgin Classics, a broadcast agreement with the BBC, and started planning our first full season of Southbank Centre concerts.

          In 2006 we launched The Night Shift, a pioneering series of late night classical music gigs. Billed as 'classical music, minus the rules', these gigs are aimed at audiences under 35 who aren't attending conventional concerts. They have evolved from large scale events at The Roundhouse and Southbank Centre's Royal Festival Hall to intimate chamber gigs in pubs. Now, we're taking what we've learnt from The Night Shift and are bringing it back to the concert hall.
